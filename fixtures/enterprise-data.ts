// The enterprise fixture: a few hundred invoices across a few dozen customers.
//
// ── Why this exists next to placeholder-data.ts rather than replacing it ────
//
// The two sets answer different questions and must not be merged.
//
//   placeholder-data.ts  a FIDELITY artifact. Verbatim next-learn — 1 user,
//                        6 customers, 13 invoices, 12 revenue months. Its value
//                        is being byte-for-byte what the tutorial ships, so any
//                        difference between the two apps on it is a difference
//                        the apps caused.
//
//   enterprise-data.ts   a MEASUREMENT artifact. Large enough that the two
//                        architectures stop looking alike: the SpyneJS side
//                        ships every invoice once in /api/bootstrap and filters
//                        in the browser, while Next.js re-queries SQL for six
//                        rows per keystroke. At thirteen invoices that
//                        difference is invisible. At five hundred it is the
//                        measurement.
//
// ── Deterministic on purpose ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every id, name, amount, date and status is derived from a fixed seed, so
// seeding twice produces byte-identical databases — including invoice UUIDs.
//
// That is deliberately UNLIKE the original set, where seedInvoices inserts
// without an id and lets uuid_generate_v4() assign one. Two independent seeds
// of placeholder-data therefore agree on content and disagree on invoice ids,
// which is why the hosted comparison branches one seeded database rather than
// seeding two (see infra/DEPLOY.md).
//
// This set removes that constraint for itself: seed it anywhere and the ids
// match, so a recorded step — delete THIS invoice, edit THAT one — is portable
// between local, Vercel and AWS.
//
// No dependency is added for any of it. The PRNG is a 32-bit xorshift and the
// UUIDs are formatted from its output, both a few lines below.
